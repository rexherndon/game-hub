# GameHub

---

GameHub is a prototype of a video game discovery web application that helps you find new and interesting games to play! In this application, you can find games based on their title, genre, platform, and more useful filters.

This application is no longer in active development, but you can find the link for the final build here ([https://game-hub-five-rose.vercel.app/](https://game-hub-five-rose.vercel.app/)).

The tools used to build this prototype are listed down below:

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- CSS and Chakra UI
- RAWG API (interface is also based off of [https://rawg.io/](https://rawg.io/))
- Axios (for handling HTTP requests)
- Zod (form validation)
- Vercel (cloud hosting)

I hope you enjoy this application, and thank you for taking the time to check this out! -Rex
